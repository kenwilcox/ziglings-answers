# Ziglings Answers

This repository contains my answers for [ziglings](https://github.com/ratfactor/ziglings)

I tried to do the challenge on 063_labels, but I couldn't ever get my changes to compile. Maybe some other day.

I used

```bash
% zig10 version
0.10.0-dev.4060+61aaef0b0
```

On macOS 12.6 and 12.6.1

The ziglings folder contains a .NET (dotnet) project that I hacked together to check in the examples once I completed the project. I was about 1/3 of the way through the exercises before I had the idea of creating a git repo for the answers and this allowed me to check them in based on the date/time I saved the files.

Zig was fun and interesting. I'm not sure if I will ever use it.

Good luck!
